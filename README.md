## Projects Overview
### Article Classification Pipeline
This project focuses on building a pipeline for classifying articles into predefined categories.
- **Feature Extraction**: Using techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings to extract meaningful features from the text.
- **Classification Models**: Applying machine learning models including Naive Bayes, SVM, and neural networks to classify articles.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the classification models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Data Clustering
This project focuses on clustering large datasets to identify patterns and group similar data points together. The primary techniques used in this project include:
- **K-Means Clustering**: A method to partition data into K distinct clusters based on feature similarity.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: A method to build a hierarchy of clusters using either a bottom-up or top-down approach.
- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**: A method to find non-linearly separable clusters based on density.

### Recommendation System
This project aims to build a recommendation system to suggest items to users based on their preferences and behaviors.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Techniques such as user-based and item-based filtering to recommend items based on user similarity.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommending items by comparing the content of items with user profiles.
- **Hybrid Methods**: Combining collaborative and content-based filtering for more accurate recommendations.

### Sentimental Regression Analysis
This project involves analyzing sentiment from textual data and predicting sentiment scores using regression techniques.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming to prepare text data for analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Using machine learning models to classify text into different sentiment categories.
- **Regression Models**: Applying regression techniques to predict sentiment scores from textual data.
